<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About The Project
This is a basic ToDo Web App that I developed for Modanisa Tech's Technologist Challenge. Mainly built with Vue.js for frontend, Express.js for backend and a great deal of coffee for me. :coffee:

Following Acceptance Test Driven Development practices, I wrote acceptance tests, consumer driven contract tests, integration tests, and unit tests for backend and frontend. 

I wish I could say it was an easy challenge for me, but I can safely and proudly say that I learned a lot doing it and enjoyed working on every part of it. Well, almost every part :sweat_smile:. 
I am thankful that I came across the obstacles that I did and I look forward to work on and learn from many projects like this. Happy coding !
